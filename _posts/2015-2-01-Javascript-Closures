description: I get on my high horse and try and explain Javascript Closures, a vexing topic and a frequent question of interviewers.
---
In all my interviews for front-end programming work I've been asked to define a Javascript Closure...it's an easy question to ask but a difficult one to answer. And I've given all kinds of muddled responses that sound like lines from a Dr. Seuss Book. As Einstein says "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."
