Two years ago to the day my room was a makeshift closet nested at the back of an old trailer with four other people in a not so parcticularly beautfiul part of California. I was a science teacher. And I loved my job, and I was completely broke.

Another coworker was a farmer in Israel.

And a friend of mine was an online art school dropout in college.

Now, all three of us are write and explain code for a living. I love my job, I love going into work, putting my headphones on and cracking into tough problems. Everyday I learn something new, and everyday my value increases exponentially...it's a great career.

Finding that first full-time job is hard. Especially in Austin where the majority of companies are startups without the resources to invest in a junior dev. You have to seperate yourself from the pack, and here's how...

1) LINKEDIN AND TWITTER ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOUR CODING SKILLS

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Increasing your online presence increases your value. Period. Companies want to hire someone that's an active part of the tech community. Tweeting regularly and gaining followers show this. Also, your linked in is the most crucial part of your portfolio. There are two types of people on LinkedIn, those who have 500+ connections and those who do not. Do it, connect with everyone. Your account will snowball and you'll get the 500 quickly.
