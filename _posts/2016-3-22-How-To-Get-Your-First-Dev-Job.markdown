Two years ago to the day my room was a makeshift closet nested at the back of an old trailer with four other people in a not so parcticularly beautfiul part of California. I was a science teacher. And I loved my job, and I was completely broke.

Another coworker was a farmer in Israel.

And a friend of mine was an online art school dropout in college.

Now, all three of us are write and explain code for a living. I love my job, I love going into work, putting my headphones on and cracking into tough problems. Everyday I learn something new, and everyday my value increases exponentially...it's a great career.

Finding that first full-time job is hard. Especially in Austin where the majority of companies are startups without the resources to invest in a junior dev. Here are ten tips to navigate through the maelstrom of a junior dev job search. :)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1)&nbsp;LINKEDIN AND TWITTER ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOUR CODING SKILLS

- Increasing your online presence increases your value. Period. Companies want to hire someone that's an active part of the tech community. Linked in is the most crucial part of your portfolio and LinkedIn Pulse is tragically underused. With Pulse you can quickly blast out a post/website/comment to all of your connections. If you make or do anything code related, make sure to send it out as a post.

- Having more connections on LinkedIn means more visibility. More visibility means more looks from potential employers and recruiters. So you're working with a bigger pond to fish in. Connections are power, and this holds true in the digital sphere as well. 


2)&nbsp;BE WARY OF THIRD PARTY RECRUITERS

- If you see a polite email or LinkedIn message from a recruiting company that is a good barometer that your online presence is up to par. However, recruiting companies can be tough to work with and although there are good ones out there, many present false hope. If the message is clearly automated, send an automated one back and see if you get the actual person on the other end. If not, move on, though take it as a good sign that you're resume and LinkedIn are attracting attention. By the end of my job search I was getting two of these messages every day.

3)&nbsp;ABC: ALWAYS BE CODING

- Start working on any project that interestes you. Don't worry about the final result, do it because it will increase your ninja powers. In fact, the more you struggle with a project, the more you will learn. If you're doing a project and not hitting any black holes, try a new technology. It's not helping you. 

- Get inspiration from going to meetups and seeing new technology that you want to take for a spin. I went to a VR meetup and was super amped to write a game in Unity. A framework I had no idea existed before that, but that gave me experience in .NET and C# which I use everyday now.

4) TAKE EVERY CONTRACT AT FIRST EVEN IF IT'S A LANGUAGE YOU DON'T KNOW

- When you first start out it's all gravy. Taking on open source projects with strange technologies will make you a better programmer and introduce you to one of the biggest challenges of being an everyday developer; reading other peoples code and working with bigger codebases. Learning how to navigate a bandaged hacky codebase will force creative solutions out of your frontal cortex. Do it.

5) KEEP YOUR HABITS AND LIFE STRUCTURE STRONG

- Wake up at 7:00, even when you're unemployed or doing only part-time contract work. Go to bed at a reasonable time (before midnight.) A single daily discipline in the morning like waking up to your alarm will increase your motivation to get out of bed and go code. Which is what you should be doing everyday.

- I broke my day down into three parts. One, code all morning on projects and contract work until 12. Two, go to coffee shop and work on LinkedIn/Twitter/Personal Site/Blog. Three, excercise.

6) Go to Hackathons and Meetups

- Try and hit at least two meetups a week. Get some business cards for these events.
