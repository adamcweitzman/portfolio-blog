    <p>Two years ago to the day my room was a makeshift closet nested at the back of an old trailer with four other people in a not so parcticularly beautfiul part of California. I was a science teacher. And I loved my job, and I was completely broke.</p>

<p>Another coworker was a farmer in Israel.</p>

<p>And a friend of mine was an online art school dropout in college.</p>

<p>Now, all three of us are write and explain code for a living.
Finding that first full-time job is hard. Especially in Austin where the majority of companies are startups without the resources to invest in a junior dev. Here is a roadmap divided into three categories: digital presence, hard skills, lifestyle.
—————————————————————————————————————————-</p>

<h1>Digital Presence</h1>
<p><br />
1) LINKEDIN AND TWITTER ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOUR CODING SKILLS</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Increasing your online presence increases your value. Companies want to hire someone that’s an active part of the tech community. LinkedIn is the best way to be sought out by, and reach out to potential employers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>LinkedIn Pulse is amazing and tragically underused by users. It’s like a facebook post but it blasts out to all of your connections, and since noone uses it; your post will show up at the top of your connections home feed. If you make or do anything code related, make sure to send it out, you’ll be surprised at the feedback you get in response.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having more connections on LinkedIn means more visibility. More visibility means more looks from potential employers and recruiters. So you’re working with a bigger pond to fish in. Connections are power, and this holds true in the digital sphere as well. Connect with anyone you can to get the 500+, because it shows that you care. There’s a snowball effect that kicks in around 350 so you can get there surprisingly fast.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you see a potential employer post on a job site, do not apply to the job on the site like a sheep, rather, reach out on LinkedIn to one of their recruiters/HR reps and get a response. Once you get them on the phone, you have shortcuted the filtering and email chain that will eliminate 90% of applicants and are already into a screening interview.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s important to show you have a Twitter account and tweet fairly frequently. To show that you give a damn about cool tech things going on. Twitter is also another good way to reach out to companies and recruiters. Also, if you tweet at a certain technology your using for example @reactjs. You will get a shout out on their page which is cool!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>2) BE WARY OF THIRD PARTY RECRUITERS</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you see a polite email or LinkedIn message from a recruiting company that is a good barometer that your online presence is up to par. However, recruiting companies can be tough to work with and although there are good ones out there, many present false hope. If the message is clearly automated, send an automated one back and see if you get the actual person on the other end. If not, move on, though take it as a good sign that you’re resume and LinkedIn are attracting attention. By the end of my job search I was getting two of these messages every day.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Hard Skills</h1>
<p><br />
1) ABC: ALWAYS BE CODING</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Start working on any project that interestes you. Don’t worry about the final result, do it because it will increase your ninja powers. In fact, the more you struggle with a project, the more you will learn. If you’re doing a project and not hitting any black holes, try a new technology. It’s not helping you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Get inspiration from going to meetups and seeing new technology that you want to take for a spin. I went to a VR meetup and was super amped to write a game in Unity. A framework I had no idea existed before that, but that gave me experience in .NET and C# which I use everyday now.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>2) TAKE EVERY CONTRACT AT FIRST EVEN IF IT’S A TECHNOLOGY YOU DON’T KNOW</p>

<ul>
  <li>When you first start out it’s all gravy. Taking on open source projects with strange technologies will make you a better programmer and introduce you to one of the biggest challenges of being an everyday developer; reading other peoples code and working with bigger codebases. Learning how to navigate a bandaged hacky codebase will force creative solutions out of your frontal cortex. Do it.</li>
</ul>

<p>3) GET SOME CODING FRIENDS</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s nice to have people around wacking their way through the same problems as you. The whole “Horses run faster when they’re together,” thing is true for coding as well</li>
</ul>

<p>4) READ CODE BOOKS</p>

<ul>
  <li>I strongly reccomend any books in the <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920027065.do" target="_blank">Head First</a> series.</li>
</ul>
